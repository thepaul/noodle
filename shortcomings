repr() of builtin types will be Python syntax instead of Noodle. Provide
  custom (nurepr) function which overrides the repr for lists, tuples, dicts?

won't be able to do any compilation or evaluation at runtime when Noodle
  runtime isn't available (which is a valid intended use for compiled
  Noodle code)

macros taking keyword arguments would be nice, but difficult to differentiate
  between intending the tuple (mkkeyword foo bar) to pass through and
  intending to give the foo:bar keyword arg to the macro.
