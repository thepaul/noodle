Noodle: aborted attempt to make a lisp-like language targeting the Python VM

So, this was mostly done 7-8 years ago, when I thought I knew a lot about
programming languages but I didn't really know squat (still don't), and I made
a bunch of bad design decisions. Once I started to realize the corners I'd
painted myself into, I took down the tarball I'd been distributing.

But now I don't mind so much being embarrassed by old stupid code, and bits and
pieces of it might be useful to other people, so here for the first time on
Github, I present Noodle.
